         between our tangible world and the digital realm.
         The three pillars of Extended Reality: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality,
         and Mixed Reality provide an immersive and interactive experience that stimulates
         our senses and enhances our perception. With the rapid pace of innovation, the only limit

          <p>“AXIS strives to keep students' sense of wonder about <br>
             science alive by giving them the necessary information as well
             as the flexibility to explore and create, in the events and
             competitions. The team's efforts have given me and the institute
            confidence that AXIS will continue to grow in size <br>
             and appeal to students in the foreseeable future as well.
             I convey my best wishes to the AXIS'23 team .”</p>
